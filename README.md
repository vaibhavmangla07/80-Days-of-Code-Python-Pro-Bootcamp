# 🐍 80 Days of Code Python Pro Bootcamp

This repository contains my progress and solutions from the **80 Days of Code Python Pro Bootcamp** challenge — a coding journey to improve Python skills by completing daily tasks and projects.

## 📌 Overview

Each folder (Day 001, Day 002, etc.) contains the code I wrote for the corresponding day of the bootcamp.  
The goal of this challenge is to practice and build confidence with Python fundamentals and projects.

## 📚 Topics Covered

This bootcamp includes core Python topics like:

- Python basics: variables, loops, conditionals, functions  
- Data manipulation with lists & dicts  
- Building small games and utilities  
- Project structure and problem solving

*(You can customize this list with what you actually covered.)*
